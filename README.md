# README

This tool is a code generation and assistance utility, allows users to define specific tasks, such as implementing new features, fixing bugs, or adding enhancements. Users can set the Task Type to organize work and specify whether the tool should adhere to custom instructions or default guidelines. It is basically a repository of prompts.

Users can drag and drop or select specific files from a project directory to share the code in the context to the prompt. This saves time copying and pasting the code that the LLM needs to be aware of.

The Task Instruction and Final Prompt sections allow users to add detailed requirements or custom instructions. The tool then aggregates these into a refined prompt for code generation, assisting the user in creating code tailored to their projectâ€™s structure and requirements.

Users can generate prompts using ChatGPT or Claude (XML style).
